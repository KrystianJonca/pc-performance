## How to contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

 - **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

 - **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.

 - **Include terminal output** with error message.

 - **Which version of Node.js are you using?** You can run `node -v` in your terminal to see the version number.

 - **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**

 - **Check your grammar!**

 > Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Pull reqests

1. Your code and commits must follow our [Styleguides](#styleguides)
2. Update the changelog in README.md with details of changes you made
3. Increase the version numbers in pakcage.json to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
4. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [Status Checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

## Styleguides

### JavaScript style guide
Always write JavaScript code that complies with [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) rules.

### Commit messages

 - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
 - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
 - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
 - Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should    look like this:
    ```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    ```
